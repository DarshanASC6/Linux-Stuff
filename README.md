# Linux Installer
 
Basically just a script for me to install some of my most used applications on Linux from the command line with relative ease. Some applications require a file to be downloaded beforehand, like LibreOffice or VS Code, but for the most part they can just be added via the command line.

I'll probably update the script at some point with functions for the special cases (the ones that require a file to be downloaded) but for now I'm happy with it.
